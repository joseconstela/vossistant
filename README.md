Multilanguage Natural Language Understanding application built in MeteorJS, using [Web Speech API / webkitSpeechRecognition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) for voice recognition and [SpeechSynthesisUtterance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesisUtterance) for Natural Language replies. Based on Intentions & Entities principle, using regular expressions.

## Example commands

*This table is just an example, as Vossistant supports multiple phrases and words that can trigger the same action.*

##Â Flow

1. The server builds a list of regex-ready commands based on [intentions](https://github.com/joseconstela/vossistant/blob/master/server/ai.js#L1) and [entities](https://github.com/joseconstela/vossistant/blob/master/server/ai.js#54), called ```intelligence```.
2. User gives a command (it creates a mongo doc)
3. If the user input matches an intelligence phrase, it calls [actions](https://github.com/joseconstela/vossistant/blob/master/server/actions.js) (if any) to create actions. See below.
4. If the ```action``` returns ```text```, then ```text``` is saved within the user's original message mongo doc. (see the [chat collection schema](https://github.com/joseconstela/vossistant/blob/master/common/collections.js))
5. ```actions``` can also contain ```commands``` as in the following example, that can be executed server-side and client-side. See [common/commands.js](https://github.com/joseconstela/vossistant/blob/master/common/commands.js)

Example of an action response:

    {
        command: {
          application: 'browser',            // Currently: 'browser' or 'meteor'
          parameters: [url]                  // ie ['example.com/?q=', 'mysearch']
        },
        display: {                           // To display something on the user's screen
          title: '',
          link: '',
          html: ''                           // Inline html to be shown
        },
        say: 'Ok, openning ' + provider,     // What the FE will "say"
        text: 'Openning ' + url.join('')     // What will attached as the user's message reply
    }
